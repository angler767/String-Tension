# String-Tension
Using experimental data from BadmintonCentral, this program returns the tension your racket is at given the frequency it pings at.
In the sport of badminton, string tension plays an important role in the sport as it affects how hard a player can hit the shuttle greatly. As a badminton stringer
and player, it is important to me to know what tension my strings are at personally so I can determine my favorite tension to play at and string in the future
and professionally to fulfill clients' requests for string tension accurately (a method of calibration). Admittedly this program does not address the fact that 
different strings ping at different frequencies even at the same tension but that can be easily adjusted once I get more data from the community.
